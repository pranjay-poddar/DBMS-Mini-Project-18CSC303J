### TECHNOLOGY USED:
* Frontend: Angular, Bootstrap

### ABSTRACT:
A well planned, systematically executed industrial training helps a great deal in inculcating a
good work culture. It provides a linkage between employees and the industry to develop
awareness of the industrial approach to problem solving based on broad understanding of
operations of the industrial organizations.

This project entitled “Employee Management System” has been designed towards improving the
Management of Employee Information in the field offices. It maintains Employee records, Leave
Records, Department, and other basic information of Employee. Various MIS reports can be
generated through it viz. Leave Order, Employee record, Position and CR Status etc. This
information is compiled and used at Headquarter Level for MIS purposes.
The project has been an enriching experience for me in the field of programming and Enterprise
Application development. The project has been developed to fulfill the requirements of the
Employees in Labor Ministry.

The tools and technologies used for developing the software are Angular for frontend, Spring
Boot for backend and MySQL for Database.
